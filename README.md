# Launch-Code
This project is a supervised classifier for predicting whether a passengar survived the Titanic disaster. Data was obtained from Kaggle.com.

The .rmd file can be run in Rstudio. The directory at the beginning of the file will need to be changed. The output is the .html file of the same name.

The titanic_classier.py runs in Python3 and requires pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn
